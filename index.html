    <h2> Where I come from </h2>
    <p class="text-margins">
      Since I was born in  July 2001, I live in Brittany, in a village called Dompierre-du-Chemin. I first left it during the week when going to High School since I had to enter a boarding school to obtain a Bachibac.
      In 2019, I started my Parisian life when I integrated my preparatory class in Henri IV. 2 years after, I started at HEC Paris in the Grande Ecole program.
      However, Brittany is still the real place I live in to me.

    <h2> What I am passionate about </h2>
      <h3> Sports </h3>
        <p class="text-margins"> After 8 years of dancing, I started weight-lifting. Going to the gym was much more convenient and I found a sport I was good at and that I was enjoying.
        When starting at HEC Paris, I tried Crossfitting and I discovered it was the best sport for me, with cardio and strength at the same time. Besides, I joined the Crossfit club, an amazing club with people from all over the world. Happy to gather and spend time together during and after the Crossfit sessions.
        </p>

      <h3> Tea </h3>
        <p class="text-margins"> I am crazy about tea, I drink tea all day. Black, green , white , Whatever ! Let's have a cup of tea ! </p>

       <h3> Travels </h3>
        <p class="text-margins"> The main country I visited was Spain, due to my eductional path in High School and my love for the Spanish language.
        I also travelled to Thailandia, Egypt, Crete, England, ... And I really enjoy discovering new cultures and habits.
        I've also spent a semester in Milan, Italy , last semester. I studied at the Bocconi University and I visited the city and its surroundings.
